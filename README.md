### **ServerLifecycleML**
**Machine Learning for Server Lifecycle Management**

## **Overview**
ServerLifecycleML is a machine learning-driven project designed to simulate and analyze server decommissioning, setup, and lifecycle management across multiple data centers. This project generates synthetic data to model real-world server operations, enabling predictive analytics and automation for infrastructure management.

## **Features**
**Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic datasets simulating server lifecycles, including provisioning, decommissioning, maintenance, and failure predictions.  
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into server utilization, performance metrics, and failure patterns.  
**Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning models to forecast server failures, maintenance needs, and decommission schedules.  
**Data Visualization**: Generates dashboards and reports for better decision-making.  
**Python & Jupyter Support**: Designed for data scientists and engineers, leveraging Jupyter notebooks and Python for analysis and experimentation.  

## **Future Enhancements**
**Integration with Cloud Platforms** (AWS, Azure, GCP) for real-time data ingestion and analysis.  
**Dashboard Development** using interactive tools like Streamlit, Dash, or Tableau.  
**Automated Server Optimization** by recommending ideal configurations based on usage patterns.  
**Anomaly Detection** to identify unusual server behavior and potential security threats.  
**Deployment as a Web App** to make predictions and insights accessible via an interactive interface.
